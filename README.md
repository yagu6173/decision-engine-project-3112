# decision-engine-project-3112


Project Proposal
CSPB 3112 
Professional Development in Computer Science


## Vision statement

This project aims to develop a comprehensive understanding of a real-time decision engine. I will gain practical and general knowledge in end-to-end design, implementation, runtime execution, and user interface, analytics tools.
Furthermore, to be an subject matter expert, I’d like to explore different types of decision engines, develop expertise in analyzing pros and cons different competitors in the market.

## Motivation

I work as a technical product manager in the space of risk detection in the payments industry. Decision engine is a critical system in this ecosystem as it helps with automated decision making based on complex business rules. Besides risk detection, in my company, decision engines are also adopted in other decisioning use cases such as trust and safety, payments routing, compliance, and recommendations. Therefore, it’s important for me to dive deep into a decision engine to gain fundamental understanding. 

## Risks to project completion

Designing and implementing a minimum viable product of decision engine will be the main risk to project completion.

1.	Lack of domain expertise in designing a MVP
Mitigation: reference a competitor product

2.	Lack of sufficient technical skills
Mitigation: leverage AI assistance to build applications
